(* Part 1: define a function that computes the parity of a list of
   booleans.

   What we want is a function even_parity such as even_parity l
   returns a boolean that combined with the elements of l the 
   number of 1â€™s (true) is even.
   This is a simple but important algorithm in data communication, its
   purpose is to detect errors (one bit flips). It is very easy to
   implement in circuit but it is not very reliable.
